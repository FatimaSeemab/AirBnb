In this project, I am to clone the front end of Airbnb.
## Goal:
The goal of this project is to learn the next JS with a tailwind and hands-on experience.
In this app development, I get a chance to practice designing headers, and foot several cards of different sizes. Furthermore, integrated dynamic calendar allows you to choose a range of dates.

## CREDITS:
I followed a 5-day coding challenge on YouTube to clone this website.

## DEPLOYMENT 
I have deployed this app on Vercel, loading it might take some time
